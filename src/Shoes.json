While the design has hit shelves in an astonishing range of materials and colours, some iterations are tougher to track down than others.

Nodding to a special edition created for athletes at MJ's alma mater, this release comes dressed in white with accents of Valour Blue. Elephant print and a stitched tag on the insole pay homage to MJ for paving the way.",
